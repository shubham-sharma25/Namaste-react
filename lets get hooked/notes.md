Decision to choose React over other frameworks and library:

why use library and framework instead of plain html css and JS?
-better developer exp with less code and more feature
-optimised app,
-fast rendering

Code organisation/folder structure
-src
-.js vs .jsx ? no difference, we can use anything
-use export default only once in a file
-file importing :-> './Header' is same as './Header.js'

default export vs named export 

-you use named export when there are multiple things to export 
-can use both default and named exports together in a file
-can have only 1 default export but can have multiple named exports
Q: can a same thing be xported as default and named ?
A: works fine
